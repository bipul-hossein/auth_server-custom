# Auth_server-custom

The authentication process for a dedicated server site with Express.js and Mongoose involves user registration, where credentials are securely hashed and stored in MongoDB. Users log in via Express routes, with authentication middleware verifying credentials. Sessions are managed using express-session, while access control middleware protects routes. Optionally, JSON Web Tokens enhance security. Password recovery routes facilitate resetting passwords. Additional security measures like rate limiting and HTTPS are implemented. Logout routes end user sessions. Comprehensive error handling ensures smooth operation. Continuous testing and updates maintain security.

## Introduction

Explain what the project is about and its purpose briefly.

## Features

1. User Registration:
Users sign up, providing information like username, email, and password. This data is encrypted and stored in MongoDB via Mongoose.

2. Login Process:
Users log in through a designated route. Express.js handles the authentication process, verifying credentials against stored data.

3. JWT Implementation:
JSON Web Tokens (JWT) can be utilized for stateless authentication, enhancing security and scalability.

4. Password Recovery:
Forgot password functionality allows users to reset passwords securely, typically involving email verification.

5. Security Measures:
Implement best practices like HTTPS, rate limiting, and input validation to mitigate common security risks.

6. Logout Functionality:
Users can securely log out, terminating their session to prevent unauthorized access.

7. Error Handling:
Implement robust error handling to provide informative responses and ensure system stability.

Continuous Updates:
Regularly update dependencies and security measures to stay resilient against evolving threats.
